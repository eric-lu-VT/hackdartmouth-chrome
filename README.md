## A chrome extension reminding you of self-care
Sadbird is a Twitter-monitoring Chrome extension which tracks the Tweets a user clicks on, and gives the user a running sentiment score consisting of a positivity-negativity index, and an emotional intensity index. Depending on whether the indexes get too strong or negative, the extension provides personalized suggestions on self-care and reminders to take breaks from twitter.
